# Brand Identity Guidelines: Monarch

## 1. Brand Core

### Mission Statement
> To enforce architectural integrity in autonomous software engineering by wrapping agent workflows in verifiable, containerized quality gates.

### Vision Statement
> To become the standard **Execution Supervisor** for the AI-native development stack, ensuring that as agents build the future, humans remain in command.

### Core Values
*   **Zero Drift**: We do not compromise on quality standards. Tasks are either verified against strict NFR gates or they are blocked. There is no middle ground.
*   **Human Sovereignty**: Agents are powerful engines, but humans are the pilots. We provide the controls, the radar, and the kill switch.
*   **Radical Transparency**: We expose the "why" behind every action. Raw logs, parsed errors, and validation states are always accessible.
*   **Deterministic Reliability**: We reject "it works on my machine." Validation happens in ephemeral, isolated Docker containers to ensure truth.

### Value Proposition
Monarch acts as the immune system for your codebase. It prevents AI agents from introducing bugs, security flaws, or architectural deviations by validating their work against strict, executable Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) gates before a task can be closed.

## 2. Brand Personality

### Brand Archetype
**The Commander (Ruler/Sage)**
Monarch is the "Fleet Command" for your local development environment. It acts with authority, precision, and foresight. It is the bridge between the chaotic potential of AI and the strict requirements of engineering. It is protective, observant, and unyielding in its standards.

### Voice & Tone
*   **Voice**: Technical, Concise, Authoritative, "Mission Control".
*   **Tone**: Objective, Alert, Calm. Monarch speaks in data, status updates, and clear directives. It is not conversational; it is functional.

**Do's and Don'ts:**
*   ✅ **Do**: Use precise engineering terminology (e.g., "Circuit Breaker", "NFR Gate", "Ephemeral").
*   ✅ **Do**: Focus on system status, metrics, and causality (e.g., "Task blocked due to Tier B Gate failure").
*   ❌ **Don't**: Use vague buzzwords like "Magic", "Supercharge", or "Unleash".
*   ❌ **Don't**: Personify the agent as a friend. The agent is a resource; Monarch is the supervisor.

## 3. Visual Identity

### Logo Usage
*   **Metaphor**: "The Sovereign Gate". An abstract, geometric crown constructed from heavy structural lines, resembling both a fortress gate and a processor die. It symbolizes the rigid NFR gates and the centralized control of the Supervisor pattern. Sharp angles, no curves.
*   **Usage**: Appears on the Dashboard header and CLI loading states.

### Color Palette

#### Primary Colors (Theme: Deep Space & Bioluminescence)
*   **Void Black**: Hex `#09090B` | *Usage*: Main application backgrounds (Dark Mode default).
*   **Reactor Blue**: Hex `#3B82F6` | *Usage*: Primary actions, active states, focus rings.

#### Status Colors (Crucial for "Fleet Command" Aesthetic)
*   **Terminal Green**: Hex `#22C55E` | *Usage*: Gate Passed, System Healthy, "All Systems Nominal".
*   **Lockdown Red**: Hex `#EF4444` | *Usage*: Validation Failure (Code Issue), Circuit Breaker Tripped.
*   **Warning Amber**: Hex `#F59E0B` | *Usage*: System Error (Tool Crash), Connecting, Warm Runner Idle.

### Typography

#### Primary Typeface: Inter
*   **Usage**: UI Labels, Headers, Navigation.
*   **Weights**: Medium, Bold (for high readability in high-density displays).

#### Secondary Typeface: JetBrains Mono
*   **Usage**: Logs, Code Snippets, Error Traces, Terminal Output.
*   **Weights**: Regular.

## 4. Imagery & Style

### UI Aesthetic: "Fleet Command"
*   **High Density**: Information-rich interfaces. Use of split panes and collapsible sidebars.
*   **HUD Elements**: "Breathing" status indicators, fine border lines (1px), semi-transparent overlays.
*   **Dark Mode**: The interface is designed primarily for dark environments to reduce eye strain during long monitoring sessions.

### Iconography
*   **Style**: Lucide / Phosphor Icons. Thin strokes (1.5px or 2px).
*   **Metaphors**: Technical and hardware-focused (e.g., microchips for processors, shields for gates, pulse lines for activity).
